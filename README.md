# Better Archiver (web extension for Firefox) [WORK IN PROGRESS]

Better Archiver is a extension that lets you save a webpage to multiple archival services ([archive.org](https://archive.org/), [archive.today](https://archive.today) and [Ghost Archive](https://ghostarchive.org)). It also lets you check if the page has already been archived.

Simply right click on a page, image or link and use the context menu to archive the page or check if the page has been previously saved.

## Installation

Addon is not yet on the Firefox Addon store, but for now you can load this repository as an [unpacked extension](https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/develop/temporary-installation-in-firefox) for development purposes.

## Usage

1. Right click on a page, link or image.
2. Use the Better Archiver menu to *save* or *check* your selected item.
3. You can also disable or enable certain archival sites via the options.
